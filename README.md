## General info
We enter data for a given word, download a txt file containing the converted code, import it to the anki program into a specially configured card template for this code.

The application accelerated adding new words by at least 2x

The application has a lot of shortcomings and bugs, but this is an application only for me and I know exactly what to do and what not to do it flawlessly.

I am not correcting it because I have other projects that are more important to me. The assumption was to make a working, unreliable application, and it is. It works for me, and that's enough for me.

From time to time I change things that turn out to be wrong in practice when learning vocabulary
